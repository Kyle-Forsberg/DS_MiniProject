Chose Data:\n\n-   we really wanted to find a data set that would apply to us and could give us results that we would care about\n\n-   We were all interested to see how a students environment effected their success in school\n\n-   Results could be used to paint a better picture for where external funding should go for students falling behind. \n\n## Clean Data\n\n-   This data set was relatively small, only 1000 entries, so there really was not that much garbage to clean out\n\n-   all exam scores ranged from 0-100, and every student had a full attribute list.\n\n\n## Transform Data\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse) \n\nStudentPerformance <- readr::read_csv(\"./datas/StudentsPerformance.csv\")\n\nnewSP <- StudentPerformance |>\n\n  mutate(mean_score = (`math score` + `reading

Organize the data into a comprehensive structure\n\n## Goals\n\n-   The goal of our project was to use the data to determine which attributes of the students were most important\n\n-   There are 5 attributes in this data set \n\n    -   Gender\n\n    -   Ethnicity\n\n    -   Education Level of the students parents\n\n    -   Whether they were enrolled in some sort of school lunch program\n\n    -   If they took any preparation courses for the exam\n\n-   We needed to compare all of these to decide which one was the most important factor in each of the 3 subjects and overall. \n\n## Process Data\n\n-   First we needed some baseline averages for each category so we have a reference to work with\n\n-   We used R to go through each column and find an average score for each section, and a average total score\n\n-   We then modeled each attribute to show its frequency in the data so we had a better idea as to what the population looked like\n\n-   \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n#| eval:

not on a school lunch assistance program scored higher than those who were\n\n# Conclusion\n\n- While there are marginal differences between many factors\n\n  - Test preperation had a large effect\n\n  - Ethnicity had a large effect\n\n  - Lunch status had a large effect\n\n- The trend here shows that the greatest factor of how the student would do is likely their parents income\n\n- while we dont have access to that data directly, we have strong reasoning\n\n  - Test preperation courses are expensive\n\n  - Being on a lunch program is generally an indicator of a low income household\n\n  - There is a similar distribution in Ethicity and test score and ethnicity and wealth\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
