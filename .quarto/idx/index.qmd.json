Chose Data:\n\n-   we really wanted to find a data set that would apply to us and could give us results that we would care about\n\n-   We were all interested to see how a students environment effected their success in school\n\n-   Results could be used to paint a better picture for where external funding should go for students falling behind. \n\n## Clean Data\n\n-   This data set was relatively small, only 1000 entries, so there really was not that much garbage to clean out\n\n-   all exam scores ranged from 0-100, and every student had a full attribute list.\n\n## Goals\n\n-   The goal of our project was to use the data to determine which attributes of the students were most important\n\n-   There are 5 attributes in this data set \n\n    -   Gender\n\n    -   Ethnicity\n\n    -   Education Level of the students parents\n\n    -   Whether they were enrolled in some sort of school lunch program\n\n    -   If they took any preparation courses for the exam\n\n-   We needed to compare all of these to decide which one was the most important factor in each of the 3 subjects and overall. \n\n## Process Data\n\n-   First we needed some baseline averages for each category so we have a reference to work with\n\n-   We used R to go through each column and find an average score for each section, and a average total score\n\n-   We then modeled each attribute to show its frequency in the data so we had a better idea as to what the population looked like\n\n-   \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: true\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nstudents <- readr::read_csv(\"./datas/StudentsPerformance.csv\")\nreadingMean <- mean(students$'reading score', na.rm = TRUE)\nwritingMean <- mean(students$'writing score', na.rm = TRUE)\nmathMean <-

attributes\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nprint(ReadingByPrep<-students %>%\n  group_by(`test preparation course`) %>%\n  summarise(avg_reading_score = mean(`reading score`, na.rm =

taken\n\n-   There was a `r avg_writing_completed - avg_writing_none`% increase for writing scores when prep courses were taken\n\n-   There was a `r avg_math_completed - avg_math_none`% increase for

Results\n\nThe effects of gender on test scores are very interesting\n\n- In Mathematics, the males pull ahead by `r avg_math_male - avg_math_female`%\n\n- In Reading and writing, the females win by a large gap\n\n  - Reading: `r avg_reading_female - avg_reading_male`% win for females\n\n  - Writing: `r avg_writing_female - avg_writing_male`% win for females\n\n\n# Effect of Ethnicity on Scores\n\n#### For this data set, there are 5 Ethnicities listed, they are Listed ethnicities A, B, C, D, E\n\n\n- To determine whether certain ethnicities accel in certain subjects, we need to
