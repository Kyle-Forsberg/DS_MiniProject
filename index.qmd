# What we did

## Chose Data:

-   we really wanted to find a data set that would apply to us and could giv eus results that we would care about

-   all of us here surely want to get good grades and do well on exams, so we decided to use that Data set.

## Clean Data

-   This data set was relatively small, only 1000 entries, so there really was not that much garbage to clean out

-   all exam scores ranged from 0-100, and every student had a full attribute list.
